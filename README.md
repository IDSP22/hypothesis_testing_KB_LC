# hypothesis_testing_KB_LC
Our app is intended to help users explore the concept of hypothesis testing and its interpretations. These concepts are framed in the context of exploring the difference in speeds between  "The Tortoise and the Hare." We guide users to investigate if there is a difference in their speeds by allowing them to play with different sample sizes/hypotheses,  set a null hypothesis and test the validity of this using an alternative hypothesis. The output of this is a distribution plot of the Hare and the Tortoise’s speeds, output of a T test. The goal of this test was to give users an understanding of how parameters for hypothesis testing can influence the significance of the difference between two means. We found that apps like BOAST’s hypothesis testing tutorial are very complex and includes too redundant inputs (multiple options for types of tests, filters specific to the population, etc) or outputs (confidence intervals, box plots on means, etc) which don’t really help the user understand fundamentally why hypothesis testing is a meaningful way to understand the differences.
