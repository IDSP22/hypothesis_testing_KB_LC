    h6("You may be familiar with the famous fable, \"The Tortoise and the Hare.\" 
       The Hare challenges an unlikely competitor, the Tortoise, to a race to 
       see which one is \"the fastest.\" While the Hare takes advantage of his 
       natural strength in speed by acting careless and taking breaks/naps 
       during the race, the Tortoise continues to move very slowly but without 
       stopping and finally wins the race. The moral lesson of the story is that 
       you can be more successful by doing things slowly and steadily than by 
       acting quickly and carelessly."),
    h6("As statisticians, we want to take a different spin and investigate if 
       the Tortoise is faster than the Hare through Hypothesis testing! 
       Hypothesis testing allows us to set a null hypothesis and test the 
       validity of this using an alternative hypothesis."),
